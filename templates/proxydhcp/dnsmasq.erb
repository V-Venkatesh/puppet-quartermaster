# Sample configuration for dnsmasq to function as a proxyDHCP server,
# enabling LTSP clients to boot when an external, unmodifiable DHCP
# server is present.
# The main dnsmasq configuration is in /etc/dnsmasq.conf;
# the contents of this script are added to the main configuration.
# You may modify the file to suit your needs.

# Don't function as a DNS server:
port=0

# Log lots of extra information about DHCP transactions.
log-dhcp

# This range(s) is for the public interface, where dnsmasq functions
# as a proxy DHCP server providing boot information but no IP leases.
# Any ip in the subnet will do, so you may just put your server NIC ip here.

# Dnsmasq can also function as a TFTP server. You may uninstall
# tftpd-hpa if you like, and uncomment the next line:
#enable-tftp

# Set the root directory for files available via FTP.

# Disable re-use of the DHCP servername and filename fields as extra
# option space. That's to avoid confusing some old or broken DHCP clients.
